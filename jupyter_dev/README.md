File descriptions:
- Read_existing_data_arrayPerParameter.ipynb
    Most functional route to go, developing this into standalone code to try on Pi
- Read_existing_data_arrayPerVessel.ipynb
    Initial trial, functions, but awkward to scale and to combine data
- Read_incoming_data_GNSSRandomDepth.ipynb
    Based on the array per parameter route, works to collect gnss data in real time
- netCDF_setup_arrayPerParameter.ipynb
    Most up to date setup, this is the route to go. May develop into standalone GUI but this is good for now
- netCDF_setup_arrayPerVessel.ipynb
    Initial trial, functions, but awkward to scale
